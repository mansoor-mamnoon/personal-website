    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h3>Technical Focus</h3>
    <p>I’m a rising junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science with interests in systems engineering, distributed infrastructure, and quantitative computing. I'm currently interning as a software engineer at Amazon, where I’m gaining hands-on experience building production-level software at scale. Due to NDA restrictions, I can’t discuss specifics — but my work focuses on solving real-world problems using data pipelines, backend services, and intelligent automation.</p>

    <h3>Teaching & Mentorship</h3>
    <p>At Berkeley, I head the education department for <strong>Blackskies Investments</strong>, the largest undergraduate investment group on campus. I lead weekly workshops on equities analysis, fundamental valuation, and portfolio strategy. This has strengthened my ability to break down complex technical and financial concepts — a skill that translates directly to high-performance teams and fast-paced decision-making environments.</p>

    <h3>Leadership</h3>
    <p>As a <strong>Residential Assistant at Clark Kerr</strong>, I support over 50 students in academic, social, and crisis management settings. This role sharpened my leadership, empathy, and communication skills — all essential when navigating technical group projects and organizational challenges.</p>

    <h3>Hands-On Learning</h3>
    <p>I enjoy building to learn — which is why this website is more than a portfolio; it’s my playground for applying new frontend techniques, design systems, and full-stack development workflows. I continuously incorporate what I learn into this site, treating it as a live showcase of technical growth.</p>

    <h3>Outside of Tech</h3>
    <p>I follow tennis and cricket, and I find that curiosity across disciplines fuels my ability to approach software problems creatively and from fresh angles.</p>

    <h3>What I’m Looking For</h3>
    <p>I’m especially excited by roles in backend engineering, infrastructure tooling, machine learning systems, or quantitative development — anywhere I can apply both algorithmic rigor and real-world pragmatism. Whether it’s scaling internal platforms or optimizing for low-latency systems, I’m driven by making high-impact ideas come alive through clean, maintainable code.</p>
