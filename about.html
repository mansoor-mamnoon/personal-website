        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I’m a rising junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science with interests in systems engineering, distributed infrastructure, and quantitative computing. I'm currently interning as a software engineer at Amazon, where I'm gaining hands-on experience building production-level software at scale. Due to NDA restrictions, I can’t discuss specifics — but my work focuses on solving real-world problems using data pipelines, backend services, and intelligent automation.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>At Berkeley, I head the education department for <strong>Blackskies Investments</strong>, the largest undergraduate investment group on campus. I lead weekly workshops on equities analysis, fundamental valuation, and portfolio strategy. This has strengthened my ability to break down complex technical and financial concepts — a skill that translates directly to high-performance teams and fast-paced decision-making environments.</p>

      </div>
      <p>As a <strong>Residential Assistant at Clark Kerr</strong>, I support over 50 students in academic, social, and crisis management settings. This role sharpened my leadership, empathy, and communication skills — all essential when navigating technical group projects and organizational challenges.</p>

          <p class="subhead">Frontend Exploration · Full-Stack Curiosity</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I enjoy building to learn — which is why this website is more than a portfolio; it’s my playground for applying new frontend techniques, layout systems, and full-stack development workflows. I continuously incorporate what I learn into real tools — improving both my intuition and design instinct.</p>
